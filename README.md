## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz


    WHEN I click the start button
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

    WHEN I answer a question
    THEN I am presented with another question

    WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock

    WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    THEN the game is over

    WHEN the game is over
    THEN I can save my initials and score

## Challenges

    I had trouble getting the syntax of getElementsByClass selector to work. So, in replacement I wrote each element out the needed to be changed.

    I also struggled with the count down timer. At the time of posting (10/3/2022) I still have not a full grasp of the tool and the syntax. The addition of a time out function and a subtraction of time I was not able to de-bug in the allocated time frame.

    Much of the time was used to develop the click-through function of the page. I was not able to put on local storage option to save scores.
